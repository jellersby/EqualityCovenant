# Equality Covenant FAQ
## Why did you create the Equality Covenant?
There are many good free codes of conduct out there for communities to adopt. In particular, I like the Contributor Covenant, which is used by many open source communities. However, at some point I began to notice that most generalized CoCs were approaching the problem from the same angle, using identical language and concepts.

The concept I encountered most frequently is one which asserts that there's only one valid way to view each other: as members of groups, all of which are locked in never-ending power struggles. Such groups can apparently be divided along pretty much any human characteristic, and often the CoCs I've found will attempt to enumerate an exhaustive list of them. Such an enumeration is ultimately unethical, never really being able to capture a true and fair set of personal characteristics for its intended purpose.

The other common concept I've found is that of "safety" elevated to paramount concern. It asserts that all people are fragile, and offending (or "harming") someone (especially on the basis of group/class membership) is liable to seriously damage them. We are therefore expected to always be policing one another for potentially offensive communications, and to set up authoritarian structures for reporting and punishing such transgressions.
When applied too broadly, I've observed this bundle of concepts to be an engine of incredible conflict and suffering. While it obviously is relevant in certain limited circumstances, it just as obviously does not apply to most human social structures and interactions, and I believe we can do much better. In the typical case, it really only serves to create an administrative class of bullies who lord their power over those without it, stifling conversation, preventing learning and growth, and eroding community trust.

And so I began experimenting: would it be possible to produce a CoC which fosters the creation and maintenance of stable and vibrant communities, while avoiding the divisive pitfalls associated with being excessively focused on group divisions and safety-obsession? I believe it is indeed possible, and I'm sharing the completed version of this CoC in the hope that it will serve as a guide for doing just that.

## Why is it called the "Equality Covenant?"
My favorite part of the human information network (the Internet) is that all participants start out as equal minds. On the network, we create spaces for discussion and collaboration, and often it's useful (indeed, necessary) to create structural rules of participation for those spaces. The ultimate goal of this CoC is to provide a framework for such a structure, while taking care to preserve that original and pure equality that we all have as network participants.
