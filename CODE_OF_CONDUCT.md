# The Equality Covenant
## Introduction
* This information space is governed by the Equality Covenant, which is a code of conduct (CoC). The goal of this CoC is to provide a framework for creating a space where all may join, collaborate, and find enjoyment via free communication as equals. To that end, violations of this CoC may be grounds for removal from this space, at the discretion of its owners and administrators.
* To create and maintain a quality collaborative space, a balance is needed between an oppressive list of rules on the one side, and totally unfettered expression on the other. This CoC favors a lightweight approach, aiming to provide clear and easy-to-follow guidelines for fostering inclusion, compassion, and freedom from harassment and threats.

## Core Rules
In this space:
1. All are welcome, including every form of self-identity, to join and participate as equals.
2. You may not harass, threaten, dox, or plan to commit violent acts on others.
3. All topics and modes of discussion are allowed; you may not demand to not be offended.
4. Participants are expected to resolve conflicts together, requesting administrative intervention only as a last resort.
5. You may not demand that others adhere to your preferred belief system or set of norms.
6. You may not communicate illegal information which would result in this space being taken offline.

## Rule Details
### Rule 1
1. Our self-identities are aspects of our subjective experiences.
2. While you are welcome to request that others honor your personal preferences (for example: pronoun usage), you are not entitled to expect admins / moderators to enforce them on your behalf.
3. Outside of this CoC, no rules based on self-identity or group/class membership are to be created or enforced in this space.

### Rule 2
1. You are harassing someone if you continue directing messages at them personally after they have made it clear that such messages are unwelcome.
2. You are threatening someone if you suggest violent or coercive action against that individual or against a group/class to which they belong.
3. You are doxing someone if you are communicating private information about them and you have not received authorization to do so.

### Rule 3
1. A message is not inherently violent; it is at the mercy of the potentially infinite processing complexity of the minds which receive it.
2. You may feel offended by a message, and you are solely responsible for your reactions to such feelings.
3. Taking offense confers no particular rights or abilities.
4. Members are not obligated to avoid joking about or otherwise discussing any forms of self-identity, culture, norm, group/class, or belief system. In fact, such behavior is encouraged, and can often lead to learning, growth, and friendship, especially when carefully honoring rule #2.

### Rule 4
1. When admins / moderators intervene in a conversation, it is usually cut short.
2. To foster organic and full conversations, please try your best to avoid involving admins / moderators unless all other avenues have been exhausted.
3. Make use of available tools to curate your own experience in this space; for example, by blocking unwanted communications.

### Rule 5
1. Dissent is an important part of learning and truth-seeking, and it is encouraged in this space as long as these core rules are honored.
2. Be flexible about your own cherished beliefs; don't uncritically assume that you alone are carrying beliefs which are purely true and purely right.

### Rule 6
1. This information space is hosted on servers which exist in one or more physical locations, and there are likely to be laws active in those locations which affect this space.
2. A list of such laws may be provided by the administrators of this space. It is your responsibility to review and honor those laws.

## Scope
This CoC applies to members while using this information space, and while representing our broader community in other spaces (especially public ones). For example: sending messages using official accounts (e-mail, social media, etc), or representing the community at a public event in the physical world.

This information space may be divided into sub-spaces; for example, a Matrix or IRC network which is composed of "rooms" by topic. Those sub-spaces may have their own set of rules and their own unique admins / moderators, but this CoC still applies there.
